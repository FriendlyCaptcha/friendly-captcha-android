This is an example app that demonstrates how to use the Friendly Captcha SDK for Android.

The app is a simple login screen that uses Friendly Captcha to protect against bots. The app is written in Kotlin and uses the Friendly Captcha SDK for Android.

## Running the example
Open the project in Android Studio, build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

The app talks to a server that is running on localhost port 3600 by default. You can find the server code in the `server` directory.

To see the end-to-end example you need to run both the server and the app. The instructions for running the server can be found in the [`server`](./server/README.md) directory.
